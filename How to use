Hello, I'm Mr.Melu, I will tell you how to use my 'mini-programs',
1.For the insta.py, you need to use command "pip install instaloader"
2.For the ip.py, you need to use two commands "pip install folium" and "pip install geocoder"
3.For the phonefinder.py you need to use command "pip install phonenumbers"
